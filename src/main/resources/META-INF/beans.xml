    Configuring a CDI Application
An application that uses CDI must have a file named beans.xml.
    The file can be completely empty (it has content only in certain limited situations),
    but it must be present.
    For a web application, the beans.xml file must be in the WEB-INF directory.
    For EJB modules or JAR files, the beans.xml file must be in the META-INF directory.
