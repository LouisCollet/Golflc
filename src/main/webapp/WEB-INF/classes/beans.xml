<!-- doit se trouver sous /src/main/resources/META-INF
I found the error....
I change the folder where beans.xml is detected.
Before was in src/main/webapp/WEB-INF
And now in src/main/resources/META-INF and works !!!

    Configuring a CDI Application
An application that uses CDI must have a file named beans.xml.
    The file can be completely empty (it has content only in certain limited situations),
    but it must be present.
    For a web application, the beans.xml file must be in the WEB-INF directory.
    For EJB modules or JAR files, the beans.xml file must be in the META-INF directory.
