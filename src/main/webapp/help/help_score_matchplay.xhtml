<b>Foursomes </b> is a competition format in which a team is comprised of two players, and those two golfers alternate hitting the same ball 
<br/>
match play, all built around its core principle: players (or teams) compete to win individual holes, with the side winning the most holes claiming the match.
<br/>
<b>Singles </b>match play pits Player A against Player B, hole after hole. If Player A scores a 4 on the first hole while Player B records a 5, Player A wins the hole.
<br/>
In <b>Fourball </b>, each side consists of two players. Each player hits his or her own golf ball throughout the round. On each hole, the low ball of the two players serves as that side's score. For example, on the first hole for Team A, Player 1 scores a 4 and Player 2 scores a 5, so the team score is 4. If Team A gets a 4 while Team B scores 5, then Team A wins the hole.
